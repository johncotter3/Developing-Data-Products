## Information Page

The vehicle fault app gives a visual display of vehicle faults found in an actual test fleet. The input data is a csv file of all vehicle faults in the test fleet. A Google Earth KML file can also be downloaded at the bottom to see a visual representation of the data on a map.  Changing the input date range will filter the faults displayed in the plots and recalculates the output data.

## Map of Faults
The autogenerated KML file utilizes Google Earth to give a visual representation of the data in relation to location.  Each point has a tooltip that gives all of the fault information.
